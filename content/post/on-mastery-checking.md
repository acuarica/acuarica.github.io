Mastery Checking is a teaching strategy.

Teaching assistant in Universita della Svizzera italiana.
Here a normal course takes a midterm and a final exam.


# What is mastery check anyway?

You evaluate by skills.

Or why Mastery Checking is not the way to teach.

To many checkings can be a problem for the student.

> Anyway, it is *NOT* a technique to teach, but a technique to evaluate.


##

Hypothesis.

The students do not know how to take exams.

this is a big problem.
realization is different than thinking?


## Solution

What do I propose?

Instead of having only midterm and final exams,
have more than two.
having four to six exams in a subject seems plausible.

Let the students "defend" the exam if they are "almost there".
