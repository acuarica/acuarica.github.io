I am a Ph.D. in Informatics at the Università della Svizzera italiana.
My main topic as a Ph.D. student was empirical studies on programming languages.
The main goal of my thesis is to understand how and **why** programming features are being used in the wild.
Since any empirical study on programming languages must be language-dependent, we focus on Java.

In the past, my research interests included functional programming--- mostly in Haskell ---,
static analysis, program transformation with Supercompilation.

Before Supercompilation, I have developed JNIF, a Java Class Files parser to be used as a native agent using JVMTI.

I worked under the advise of Prof. Matthias Hauswirth and Prof. Nate Nystrom.
I have worked for more than 10 years in private industry in different roles, 
as Software Developer, Software Engineer, Network Administrator and 
Freelance Developer.
Master in Computer Science from the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina.
Also Teaching Experience as Teaching Assistant in both USI and University of Buenos Aires.
