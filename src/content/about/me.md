I worked in the Web3 space for more than 2 years.
I worked with [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) & [NEAR](https://near.org/), [Avalanche](https://www.avax.network/), [EOS/WAX](https://www.wax.io/) and [Everscale (TON)](https://everscale.network/) using **Solidity**, **Rust** and **TypeScript/JavaScript**.
Moreover, I have worked for more than 10 years in private industry in different roles, as Software Engineer, Network Administrator and Freelance Developer.

I have a Ph.D. in Informatics at the Università della Svizzera italiana, Switzerland.
The topic of my Ph.D. was empirical studies on programming languages.
Its main goal was to understand how and why programming features are being used in the wild.

Interests

- Typescript/Javascript, Rust & Solidity
- Web3, Smart Contracts, Ethereum & EVM-based blockchains
- Partial & Symbolic Evaluation, Supercompilation
- Static & Dynamic Analysis
- Education in Computer Science
